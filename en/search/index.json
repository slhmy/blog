[{"content":"Today, I opened my blog workplace and decided to write something about my latest work. It was kind of weird that after I ran hugo server and visit the development site, I seen nothing but a white page. I found this kind of strange things bother me a lot, so I decide to do some more to record them in case I meet them again.\nThis post can be very easy currently, wether it will become more complex depends on the amount of problems.\nFound no layout file for \u0026ldquo;HTML\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; Description: Run hugo server and visit the development site, see nothing but a white page.

This issue is likely to appear after I clean my computer with rubbish cleaner.\n","date":"2022-09-09T15:48:00+08:00","permalink":"https://slhmy.github.io/blog/en/p/hugo-doesnt-work/","title":"Hugo doesn't work"},{"content":"Monotone stack is a simple data structure, but I often forget to use it when I need it. This is a very strange thing, because the monotone stack is indeed a kind of \u0026ldquo;look at it and you will know\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; The reason for this situation is actually very simple: I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the essence of the monotone stack.\nThe essence of monotone stack In fact, the essence of the monotone stack is very simple, and we can understand it by splitting words.\nFirst of all, it is monotone, which describes the arrangement of elements in the stack. It is a form of arrangement that is ordered from top to bottom (or from bottom to top).\nThen it is stack, which represents that we only care about the top of the stack in a certain state.\nProblem matching After understanding the essence, we need to think about what kind of problems are suitable for solving with monotone stack.\nFirst of all, the ordered characteristics of the monotone stack constrain it, it is only suitable for solving problems where the order is ordered, that is to say, if the problem requires random queries, then without pre-tabulation, the monotone stack cannot solve such problems.\nThen, the single-end feature of the stack actually implies that we seem to need the next maximum (or minimum) information, because we don\u0026rsquo;t seem to need to pay attention to the other contents of the stack, so it is a scene of seeking the maximum value in a certain state. From another perspective, when only the maximum value is concerned, the values of other parts are ignored, so the monotone stack also has the characteristic of ignoring data noise during traversal (Ex. When ignoring the minimum on the right, we don\u0026rsquo;t care about the other larger values on the right, so we can use the monotone stack to solve it).\n","date":"2022-09-01T20:56:00+08:00","permalink":"https://slhmy.github.io/blog/en/p/monotone-stack/","title":"Monotone Stack"}]
